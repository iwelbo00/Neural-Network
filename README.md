# Neural-Network
A Neural Network that is capable of taking in a 28x28 pixel image of a hand drawn number and telling you what number is drawn.
The hand drawn image must be compressed into a single line of values first, you can run the network with the data then. My model is able to predict the number correctly 90% of the time.
This Neural-Network was made entirely from scratch with no libraries!
